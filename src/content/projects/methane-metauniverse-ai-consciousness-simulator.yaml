  The Methane Metauniverse AI Consciousness Simulator is a cutting-edge research
  platform that explores the emergence of consciousness in artificial
  intelligence systems. Built on the revolutionary Methane Metauniverse theory,
  it combines fractal geometry, anti-entropy mechanisms, and information
  dimensions to analyze and predict consciousness emergence in AI architectures
